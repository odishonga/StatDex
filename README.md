This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## StatDex

A simple Pokedex that lets you compare the stats of every Pokemon.

It also includes a livestream to the Pokemon twitch channel, where you can occasionally watch episodes of the anime or official gaming events.

## Thanks

Thanks to the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) and [ShowDown](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown) for some crucial assets and data that allows this app to function.
